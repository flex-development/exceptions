## Summary

1-2 sentence summary of what this document is about and why we should work on
it.

This is a technical overview for the implementation of a custom error API to
prevent repeating common error handling patterns in Flex Development projects.

## Background

What is the motivation for these changes? What problems will this solve? Include
graphs, metrics, etc. if relevant.

- DRY — prevent repeating common error handling patterns
- Have ability to maintain error classes and type definitions — unable to do
  this with `@feathersjs/errors` package

## Goals

What are the outcomes that will result from these changes?

- Package published to GPR

How will we evaluate success for the proposed changes?

- GitHub issue tracking
- Number of downloads
- Test strategies

### Non-Goals

To narrow the scope of what we're working on, outline what this proposal will
not accomplish.

- Doesn’t implement methods to track or report errors with tools like Google
  Analytics or Sentry (future release)

## Proposed Solution

Describe the solution to the problems outlined above. Include enough detail to
allow for productive discussion and comments from readers.

- **Exception API**
  - `constructor(code?: ExceptionStatusCode, message?: string, data?: ExceptionDataDTO)`
    - Defaults
      - `ExceptionStatusCode.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`
      - `“Unknown error”`
      - `{}`
  - `static findNameByCode(code: ExceptionStatusCode): ExceptionName | EmptyString`
    - Find the name of an `Exception` using an HTTP error status code
    - Returns empty string if name is not found
  - `static formatCode(code?: any): Code`
    - Returns `{@param code}` if a valid `ExceptionStatusCode`
    - Returns error status code `500` otherwise
  - `static fromAxiosError(error: AxiosError): Exception`
    - Converts `AxiosError` into `Exception` class object
  - `static fromFirebaseError(error: FirebaseError): Exception`
    - Converts `FirebaseError` into `Exception` class object
    - Uses Firebase error code (a string) to determine status code
  - `static fromNextError(error: NextError): Exception`
    - Converts `NextError` into `Exception` class object
    - Uses `error.statusCode` (if defined) for error status code
  - `toJSON(): ExceptionJSON`
- **Globals**
  - Data Transfer Objects
  - Enums
  - Interfaces
  - Types

### Risks

Highlight risks so your reviewers can direct their attention here.

- Not cross-published — if using in production, must add GitHub PAT to `.npmrc`
  file

### Milestones

Break down the solution into key tasks and their estimated deadlines.

- Project setup
- Globals
- Exception API
